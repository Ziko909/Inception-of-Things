# 🛰️ Inception-of-Things (IoT) — DevOps  Project

⚙️ A hands-on, cloud-native DevOps project showcasing modern infrastructure automation using K3s, K3d, and Vagrant. 🌐 Master virtualized environments, deploy containerized microservices, and implement GitOps workflows with Argo CD. 🚀 Gain practical experience in Kubernetes-native orchestration, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and scalable CI/CD pipelines.

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Concepts

- 🐳 **Docker** — Containerization engine used across all stages  
- 📦 **Vagrant + VirtualBox** — VM provisioning and environment isolation  
- ☸️ **K3s** — Lightweight Kubernetes distribution for edge and test clusters  
- 🧪 **K3d** — K3s-in-Docker for rapid local cluster orchestration  
- 📡 **Ingress Controller** — NGINX-powered virtual host routing  
- 🚀 **Argo CD** — GitOps continuous delivery with declarative sync  
- 🌐 **Multi-service Architecture** — Isolated apps routed via domain-based access  
- 🛠️ **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** — Automated provisioning and deployment  
- 📁 **CI/CD Pipelines** — GitHub-driven configuration + ArgoCD sync  
- 🗂️ **Namespaces** — Production-like resource isolation
